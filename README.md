Enabling machines to "learn on the go" involves the implementation of **online learning** techniques, which allow systems to adapt continuously as new data becomes available. This approach contrasts with traditional offline learning, where models are trained once and then applied without further updates.

Here are several key techniques and concepts that enable machines to learn dynamically:

### 1. **Online Learning Algorithms**
   - Online learning processes one data point at a time and updates the model incrementally. Some common online learning algorithms include:
     - **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):** Processes one data sample at a time, updating the model iteratively.
     - **Perceptron Algorithm:** A linear classifier updated with each misclassification.
     - **Online versions of decision trees**, like Hoeffding Trees, which incrementally adapt to new data.

### 2. **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**
   - RL allows agents to learn through interactions with the environment, receiving feedback (rewards) and updating their knowledge to maximize future rewards.
     - **Q-Learning:** Agents learn optimal policies by updating the value of state-action pairs based on experience.
     - **Deep Reinforcement Learning:** Combines deep learning with RL, enabling learning in more complex environments.

### 3. **Transfer Learning**
   - Pre-trained models are updated with new tasks or new data. In the "learning on the go" context, transfer learning enables a machine to adapt pre-existing knowledge to new but related tasks.

### 4. **Active Learning**
   - In active learning, a model selectively queries for more information (or labels) from an external source, allowing it to focus learning on uncertain or misclassified examples.

### 5. **Continual/Lifelong Learning**
   - Continual learning techniques allow models to accumulate knowledge over time without forgetting previous tasks (overcoming **catastrophic forgetting**).
     - **Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC):** Helps models retain important weights for old tasks while learning new tasks.
     - **Progressive Neural Networks:** Maintain separate models for different tasks but share knowledge across them.

### 6. **Incremental Learning for Anomaly Detection**
   - When a machine must adapt to new situations, anomaly detection algorithms can identify deviations in real-time and adjust the learning model to handle new situations or abnormal conditions.

### 7. **Edge Computing**
   - Implementing learning models on the edge (e.g., drones, cameras) allows devices to process information locally and adapt to changing conditions in real-time without relying on cloud connectivity.

### 8. **Adaptive Neural Networks**
   - These networks adjust their architecture (e.g., neuron connections) in real-time as they encounter new data, ensuring continuous improvement.

### 9. **Memory-Augmented Networks**
   - Memory-augmented neural networks (MANNs) store information in an external memory module, allowing the machine to refer to past experiences and adapt in dynamic environments.

### 10. **Self-Supervised Learning**
   - Self-supervised methods extract useful representations from the environment without explicit labels, enabling systems to learn as they encounter new data, particularly useful for continuous streams like video.

In your case of working with rotating cameras for maritime object detection, you could integrate online learning models, potentially with reinforcement learning, allowing the system to improve its accuracy and adapt to different environmental conditions as it captures more data. Using adaptive neural networks or active learning would enable the system to adjust to changing conditions like lighting, camera position, or object appearance.
