### Best Method for Your Use Case (Maritime Detection and Tracking):
For your project involving a rotating camera system with electro-optical and infrared inputs, an ideal solution might be a combination of:
- **Transfer Learning** for leveraging pre-trained CNNs or object detection models (e.g., YOLO, Faster R-CNN) and fine-tuning them in real-time as new data becomes available.
- **Few-Shot Learning** for adapting to new objects in the maritime domain with minimal labeled data.
- **Lifelong Learning** to ensure the system adapts to new objects or environments while retaining past knowledge (e.g., previously seen ships or equipment).
- **Reinforcement Learning** for scenarios where real-time feedback from the environment (such as tracking success) can be used to improve detection or identification strategies.

Would you like to explore a specific combination of these methods or dive deeper into one of them for implementation?

To implement **identification of unseen ships** "on the go" with a rotating camera system using **transfer learning**, **few-shot learning**, **lifelong learning**, and **reinforcement learning**, you need to combine these methods in a cohesive pipeline. Below is an approach to integrate these techniques effectively for maritime object detection and identification:

### **1. Transfer Learning for Initial Ship Detection**

**Objective**: Start with a pre-trained model and fine-tune it to recognize ships in various conditions (day/night, electro-optical/infrared).

- **Model Selection**: Use a pre-trained model such as **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** or **Faster R-CNN** that is effective for real-time object detection. These models can be fine-tuned for ship detection by training on a maritime dataset (if available) and augmenting it with synthetic images or data generated from simulators.
  - **YOLOv5** or **YOLOv8**: Great for real-time object detection on edge devices with faster inference.
  - **Faster R-CNN**: More accurate, but slower. Suitable if speed is not a critical issue.

**Steps**:
1. **Preprocessing**: Prepare a dataset with labeled ships, including different types, angles, and conditions (e.g., electro-optical and infrared inputs). If real data is limited, generate synthetic ship images or augment the data with noise, flips, rotations, and occlusions.
2. **Fine-tuning**:
   - Load a model pre-trained on a large object detection dataset (like ImageNet or COCO).
   - Fine-tune the last few layers of the model on your ship dataset, ensuring it learns the specific features of maritime objects while preserving general object recognition capabilities.
3. **On-the-Go Learning**:
   - As the rotating camera collects new images, update the model by fine-tuning on a small batch of newly labeled images (this is similar to **online learning**). For efficient updates, use a low learning rate to avoid overfitting.

### **2. Few-Shot Learning for Recognizing New Types of Ships**

**Objective**: Quickly adapt to new, unseen ships with only a few examples.

- **Model Selection**: Use a model architecture suitable for few-shot learning, such as **Prototypical Networks** or **Matching Networks**. These models are designed to learn from very few examples (1-5 samples per new class).

**Steps**:
1. **Feature Extraction**: Use the base CNN (fine-tuned during transfer learning) as a feature extractor. The idea is to leverage its ability to detect important features of ships.
2. **Few-Shot Learning Pipeline**:
   - **Prototypical Networks**: Create prototypes (feature averages) for each class. When a new, unseen ship is detected, use the feature extractor to create a prototype and compare it with other prototypes to classify the new ship.
   - **Matching Networks**: Compare the new ship’s features directly with a small support set (the few known examples) and classify it based on similarity.
3. **Real-Time Adaptation**: When a new ship type is encountered (e.g., new class of vessel), you need only a few labeled examples to fine-tune the few-shot model and classify the unseen ships.

**Key Implementation Tools**:
   - Use libraries like **PyTorch Meta-learning library** (e.g., **PyTorch-Meta**) or custom implementations of Prototypical Networks.

### **3. Lifelong Learning to Avoid Forgetting Previous Ships**

**Objective**: Prevent the system from forgetting previously seen ships as it learns to identify new ones (known as **catastrophic forgetting**).

- **Model Selection**: Combine your CNN model with **Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC)** or use **Progressive Neural Networks**.

**Steps**:
1. **Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC)**:
   - When fine-tuning the model on new ship types, apply a regularization technique (like EWC) that selectively preserves the weights associated with old tasks (i.e., previously seen ships). This prevents the model from forgetting how to identify older ships while learning to recognize new ones.
   - In EWC, the importance of each parameter is measured based on how crucial it was for identifying previous ship types. When the model is fine-tuned for new ships, only non-crucial parameters are updated, ensuring old knowledge is preserved.
   
2. **Progressive Neural Networks**:
   - If you anticipate a significant number of new ship types, progressively add new columns (neural network layers) to the model. Each new column learns to identify new ships, while old columns are frozen, retaining the previous ship knowledge.
   - Progressive Neural Networks allow lateral connections between new and old columns, enabling transfer of knowledge between tasks without interference.

**Key Implementation**:
   - Implement EWC in PyTorch using custom regularization on weights, or use pre-existing implementations like `PyTorch EWC`.

### **4. Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Identification**

**Objective**: Adapt the system to optimize ship identification in dynamic environments, such as changing camera angles, lighting, and occlusions.

- **Model Selection**: Use **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)**, such as **Deep Q-Learning (DQN)** or **Policy Gradient Methods**.
   - **Deep Q-Learning (DQN)**: Learn to take actions that maximize reward (e.g., correct identification of a ship) by interacting with the environment.
   - **Policy Gradient**: If your camera or drone has control over its actions (zooming, panning, etc.), policy gradient methods could be used to optimize its behavior for better identification.

**Steps**:
1. **Reward Function Design**:
   - Define a reward signal based on the accuracy of ship identification. For example:
     - **Positive rewards**: Correctly identifying a ship type.
     - **Negative rewards**: Failing to identify a ship or misclassifying it.
2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:
   - During real-time operation, the system can explore different strategies for viewing, detecting, or tracking ships in various conditions (lighting, angles, etc.).
   - As the system learns the best strategies, it should exploit this knowledge to improve accuracy.
3. **Training**:
   - Use the ship detection module (based on CNNs and transfer learning) as the base for extracting image features.
   - Train a DQN or policy gradient model to optimize the identification process based on these features.
4. **Real-Time Decision Making**:
   - Once the model has been trained, it can adjust parameters like focus, zoom, or image capture timing in real-time to optimize the ship identification process.

**Key Implementation Tools**:
   - Use **OpenAI Gym** for simulating the maritime environment.
   - Use libraries like **Stable Baselines3** in PyTorch for reinforcement learning.

---

### **Integration Workflow: Putting it All Together**

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - Load a pre-trained model (e.g., YOLO) and fine-tune it on an initial ship dataset.
   - Set up the system to continuously collect new images using the rotating camera (electro-optical/infrared).

2. **Real-Time Identification**:
   - As the system encounters unseen ships, use transfer learning (fine-tuning) to adapt the model.
   - If few labeled images are available for new ship types, apply few-shot learning to quickly classify new ships.

3. **Long-Term Adaptation**:
   - Regularly update the model to ensure it adapts to new ships while retaining old knowledge using EWC or Progressive Neural Networks.
   - Continuously apply reinforcement learning to optimize the identification process based on environmental conditions (lighting, angles).

4. **Deployment on Edge Devices**:
   - Ensure that models are optimized for deployment on edge devices (e.g., drones or surveillance cameras). Use models like YOLO or MobileNet for inference, and use frameworks like **TensorFlow Lite** or **OpenVINO** for edge deployment.

---

### Summary:
1. **Transfer Learning**: Start with pre-trained models and fine-tune them for ship identification.
2. **Few-Shot Learning**: Adapt to new, unseen ships with only a few labeled images.
3. **Lifelong Learning**: Avoid catastrophic forgetting of old ships while learning to identify new ones.
4. **Reinforcement Learning**: Optimize the system's identification accuracy in dynamic environments.

Great! Let’s start with **Transfer Learning** for ship identification using a pre-trained model. I'll guide you through the process using **YOLOv5**, which is a popular, fast, and lightweight model that can be fine-tuned for detecting ships.

### **Steps for Implementing Transfer Learning with YOLOv5 for Ship Identification**

---

### **Step 1: Set Up Your Environment**

#### 1.1 Install YOLOv5 Dependencies
You’ll need Python, PyTorch, and some libraries like `torchvision` and `opencv`. If you're working on a machine with a GPU, make sure CUDA is installed for faster training.

You can install YOLOv5 dependencies with the following commands:

```bash
# Clone YOLOv5 repository
git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5
cd yolov5

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 1.2 Prepare Your Dataset
You need a dataset of labeled ships. Each image should have an annotation file in YOLO format. The dataset should be divided into:
- `train`: Images for training the model.
- `val`: Images for validation.

For each image, there should be a corresponding `.txt` file containing:
- Class index (e.g., `0` for ships).
- Bounding box coordinates (center `x`, center `y`, width, height).

If you don’t have a dataset, you can use public datasets like **SeaShips**, or create your own using tools like **LabelImg** for annotation.

The folder structure should look like this:
```
/data
  /images
    /train
    /val
  /labels
    /train
    /val
```

---

### **Step 2: Fine-Tuning YOLOv5 on Your Dataset**

#### 2.1 Modify the Dataset YAML File
Create a YAML file for your dataset to inform YOLOv5 of your training and validation data. This file defines the location of the dataset and the class labels.

Create a file called `ships.yaml`:
```yaml
train: /path/to/your/data/images/train  # Path to training images
val: /path/to/your/data/images/val  # Path to validation images

nc: 1  # Number of classes (for ships, set it to 1)
names: ['ship']  # Class name
```

#### 2.2 Download a Pre-Trained YOLOv5 Model
YOLOv5 models are already pre-trained on the **COCO dataset**, which includes 80 object classes. You’ll fine-tune it on your ship dataset.

```bash
# Download YOLOv5 model (small version for faster training)
python models/yolov5s.pt
```

#### 2.3 Train the Model
Now, fine-tune the pre-trained YOLOv5 model on your ship dataset. The training script takes your dataset and the pre-trained weights, and performs transfer learning.

Run the following command:

```bash
# Train YOLOv5 on your dataset
python train.py --img 640 --batch 16 --epochs 100 --data ships.yaml --weights yolov5s.pt --cache
```

- **`--img 640`**: Image size for input (you can adjust based on your dataset).
- **`--batch 16`**: Batch size (adjust based on your hardware capacity).
- **`--epochs 100`**: Number of epochs (higher values may result in better accuracy but take longer).
- **`--weights yolov5s.pt`**: Using the pre-trained weights of YOLOv5 for transfer learning.
- **`--data ships.yaml`**: Path to your dataset file.
- **`--cache`**: Cache images for faster training.

#### 2.4 Monitor the Training
YOLOv5 automatically generates training logs, including accuracy, precision, and loss. You can monitor this in real-time, or check results in the `runs/train/exp/` directory where model checkpoints and visualizations are saved.

---

### **Step 3: Evaluate and Fine-Tune the Model**

#### 3.1 Evaluate the Model on Validation Data
Once training is complete, YOLOv5 will generate evaluation metrics such as **Precision**, **Recall**, and **mAP (mean Average Precision)** for object detection. You can improve these metrics by further fine-tuning the hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, augmentation settings).

```bash
# Run evaluation on validation set
python val.py --weights runs/train/exp/weights/best.pt --data ships.yaml --img 640
```

#### 3.2 Test the Model on New Images
You can use the fine-tuned model to test on new images and detect ships.

```bash
# Run inference on new images
python detect.py --weights runs/train/exp/weights/best.pt --img 640 --conf 0.25 --source /path/to/test/images
```

- **`--conf 0.25`**: Confidence threshold for detecting ships.
- **`--source /path/to/test/images`**: Path to the test images directory.

The detected images will be saved in the `runs/detect/exp/` folder.

---

### **Step 4: Fine-Tune Further with Online Learning (Optional)**

As your system continues to capture new images in real-time, you can implement **online learning** to further fine-tune the model on newly encountered ship data.

- You can run periodic training updates on small batches of newly labeled data.
- Use the new images in mini-batches (e.g., 5-10 images at a time) to update the model weights incrementally.

---

### **Step 5: Deployment**

Once the model is trained and fine-tuned, you can deploy it on your edge device (e.g., drone or rotating camera system). YOLOv5 supports lightweight deployment using:

- **TensorFlow Lite** for mobile and embedded devices.
- **ONNX** format for hardware acceleration on GPUs.
- **OpenVINO** for edge AI applications.

For TensorFlow Lite:

```bash
# Export the trained model to TensorFlow Lite
python export.py --weights runs/train/exp/weights/best.pt --img 640 --include tflite
```

For ONNX or OpenVINO, you can adjust the `--include` flag accordingly.

---

### **Summary of the Process**:

1. **Prepare the dataset**: Collect and label ship images.
2. **Fine-tune a pre-trained YOLOv5 model**: Train on the ship dataset using transfer learning.
3. **Evaluate and fine-tune**: Check the model’s performance on the validation set and adjust.
4. **Test the model**: Run inference on new ship images.
5. **Deploy**: Export the trained model for real-time applications on edge devices.

---

This method enables you to leverage the power of transfer learning for ship identification, which can be further adapted for real-time learning as your system encounters unseen ships. Would you like sample code for specific sections or further clarification on any of the steps?

---

Switching back to a more robust method like **YOLO** is a great decision, especially for complex tasks such as identifying ships in varied and challenging environments like the maritime domain, where factors like weather, lighting, and ship angles vary significantly.

### **Advantages of YOLO for Complex Ship Identification Tasks:**
- **Real-Time Performance**: YOLO (You Only Look Once) processes entire images at once and is optimized for speed and real-time applications, which is ideal for live video from drones or cameras.
- **Generalization**: YOLO is trained on deep neural networks, which allow it to generalize well across different images with diverse environmental conditions.
- **Robust Detection**: YOLO uses CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) to detect objects, which means it can handle complex images with varying backgrounds, multiple objects, and intricate details.
- **Flexible Deployment**: YOLO models can be exported for deployment on edge devices like drones or integrated systems.

Let’s go deeper into the YOLO setup process and highlight the more advanced aspects of training for ship identification. Here's the plan:

### **Advanced YOLO Setup for Complex Ship Detection**

---

### **Step 1: Environment Setup and Model Selection**

#### 1.1 Hardware Considerations
For real-time detection, especially in demanding environments, you’ll benefit from GPU acceleration. Check if CUDA is installed for NVIDIA GPUs, or if you're using specialized hardware like Jetson or Coral devices.

```bash
# Check if CUDA is enabled
python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"
```

If you don’t have a powerful GPU, you can still train smaller YOLO models, such as YOLOv5s (small) or YOLOv5n (nano), or use cloud services like Google Colab for faster training.

#### 1.2 Install YOLOv5

If you haven’t already set it up:

```bash
# Clone YOLOv5 repository
git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5
cd yolov5

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### **Step 2: Dataset Preparation for Ship Detection**

The success of a deep learning model is highly dependent on the quality of the dataset. Since you are working in the maritime domain:

#### 2.1 Dataset Collection
- **Public Datasets**: If you haven’t collected enough data, consider using public ship datasets such as **SeaShips** or **DOTA** (aerial images of ships).
- **Custom Dataset**: Capture images from the rotating camera setup, drones, or other surveillance systems. Ensure diversity in angles, lighting (day/night), weather, and sea conditions.

#### 2.2 Dataset Annotation
YOLO models require annotated images in a specific format: 
- Each image needs an annotation `.txt` file containing the class and bounding box coordinates.
- Tools like **LabelImg** or **Roboflow** can be used for labeling.

Each annotation should follow this format:
```
<class> <x_center> <y_center> <width> <height>
```
For example:
```
0 0.45 0.60 0.30 0.25
```
Where:
- `class`: Class index (e.g., `0` for ship).
- `x_center`, `y_center`: The coordinates of the center of the bounding box, normalized between 0 and 1.
- `width`, `height`: The width and height of the bounding box, also normalized.

#### 2.3 Organize Dataset
Your folder structure should look like this:
```
/dataset
  /images
    /train
    /val
  /labels
    /train
    /val
```

---

### **Step 3: Training YOLOv5 for Ship Detection**

#### 3.1 Configure Dataset YAML File

Create a `.yaml` file for your ship detection task. For example, a file called `ships.yaml` could look like this:

```yaml
train: /path/to/your/data/images/train  # Path to training images
val: /path/to/your/data/images/val  # Path to validation images

nc: 1  # Number of classes (1 class for ships)
names: ['ship']  # Class name
```

#### 3.2 Select a Pre-Trained Model

For robust ship detection, YOLOv5 provides multiple pre-trained models:

- `yolov5s.pt`: Small model, lightweight and fast.
- `yolov5m.pt`: Medium model, a good balance between accuracy and speed.
- `yolov5l.pt`: Large model, for higher accuracy but requires more computational power.
- `yolov5x.pt`: Extra-large model, provides the best accuracy but is slower.

Download the model best suited for your hardware and requirements:

```bash
# Example: Download the small model for faster training
python models/yolov5s.pt
```

#### 3.3 Start Training

You can now start training on your custom dataset using transfer learning. YOLO will use pre-trained weights and fine-tune them for your specific task.

```bash
python train.py --img 640 --batch 16 --epochs 100 --data ships.yaml --weights yolov5s.pt --cache
```

- **`--img 640`**: Size of input images (you can experiment with larger or smaller sizes).
- **`--batch 16`**: Batch size (adjust based on GPU memory).
- **`--epochs 100`**: Number of epochs (increase for better performance, but be mindful of overfitting).
- **`--weights yolov5s.pt`**: The pre-trained model weights to use for transfer learning.
- **`--data ships.yaml`**: The dataset configuration file.
- **`--cache`**: This caches the dataset for faster loading.

#### 3.4 Monitor Training

YOLOv5 provides detailed logs and charts for tracking loss, mAP (mean average precision), and other metrics. It also saves the best model automatically in the `runs/train/exp/weights` directory.

---

### **Step 4: Fine-Tuning for Better Performance**

If your model performance is not satisfactory, or you notice issues like overfitting or underfitting, you can try these techniques:

#### 4.1 Adjust Hyperparameters
Fine-tune parameters like learning rate, augmentation, and optimizer. YOLOv5 has a built-in hyperparameter evolution function, which automatically searches for optimal hyperparameters based on your dataset.

```bash
# Hyperparameter evolution
python train.py --img 640 --batch 16 --epochs 100 --data ships.yaml --weights yolov5s.pt --evolve
```

#### 4.2 Data Augmentation
YOLOv5 includes built-in augmentations like flipping, rotation, and scaling. You can further tweak these settings in the `hyp.scratch.yaml` file if needed.

---

### **Step 5: Test and Evaluate the Model**

Once the model is trained, evaluate it on new, unseen images or the validation dataset.

```bash
# Evaluate model performance
python val.py --weights runs/train/exp/weights/best.pt --data ships.yaml --img 640
```

The evaluation will generate metrics such as **Precision**, **Recall**, and **mAP**. Check these values to understand the model’s accuracy.

---

### **Step 6: Run Inference on New Images or Videos**

To run the model on a new image or video for ship detection:

```bash
# Run inference on test images
python detect.py --weights runs/train/exp/weights/best.pt --img 640 --conf 0.25 --source /path/to/test/images
```

- **`--weights runs/train/exp/weights/best.pt`**: The best model weights from training.
- **`--conf 0.25`**: Confidence threshold for detecting ships (adjust this for more or fewer detections).
- **`--source`**: Path to the test image folder, a video file, or even a live stream (e.g., `0` for webcam).

Detected ships will be displayed with bounding boxes and saved in the `runs/detect/exp/` directory.

---

### **Step 7: Deploy on Edge Devices**

Once the model is trained and optimized, you can deploy it on edge devices (like drones or cameras) to perform real-time ship detection.

#### 7.1 Export to TensorFlow Lite or ONNX

YOLOv5 can be exported to lightweight formats like **TensorFlow Lite**, **ONNX**, or **CoreML** for deployment on mobile or edge devices.

```bash
# Export the trained model to TensorFlow Lite
python export.py --weights runs/train/exp/weights/best.pt --img 640 --include tflite
```

For ONNX:

```bash
# Export to ONNX format
python export.py --weights runs/train/exp/weights/best.pt --img 640 --include onnx
```

You can then deploy the model on devices with optimized runtimes, such as TensorFlow Lite for mobile devices or ONNX Runtime for hardware acceleration.

---

### **Summary of YOLOv5 Steps for Ship Detection:**
1. **Dataset Preparation**: Collect and label a diverse dataset of ships.
2. **Fine-Tune YOLOv5**: Use a pre-trained model and perform transfer learning on your ship dataset.
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Adjust the learning rate, augmentation, and other parameters to improve performance.
4. **Inference**: Detect ships in real-time using test images or video streams.
5. **Deployment**: Export the model for edge devices like drones or cameras for real-time detection.

 Great! Preparing the dataset is one of the most important parts of the process for training a YOLO model. Here’s a step-by-step guide to prepare the dataset for ship detection, ensuring it's optimized for YOLOv5.

---

### **Step 1: Dataset Collection**

#### 1.1 **Gathering Images**
The first step is to gather images of ships that reflect the conditions in which your model will be deployed. Since you are dealing with maritime environments, the dataset should include:

- **Varied ship types**: Different sizes, shapes, and classes (e.g., cargo ships, fishing boats, naval vessels, etc.).
- **Different perspectives**: Include aerial views from drones, images from rotating cameras, and other angles.
- **Environmental diversity**: Gather images from different weather conditions (clear skies, foggy, rainy), lighting conditions (day/night), and sea conditions (calm, rough).

You can source images from:
- **Publicly available datasets** (e.g., SeaShips, DOTA, etc.).
- **Manually captured images** from drones or surveillance cameras.
- **Synthetic images** generated using simulation environments (for specific training needs).

#### 1.2 **Dataset Size**
The more images you have, the better the model will generalize, but a good starting point is around **1,000–3,000 images**. If you don't have access to that many, you can enhance your dataset with **data augmentation** later.

---

### **Step 2: Dataset Annotation**

Each image needs to be labeled with the ship's location (bounding boxes) and class. YOLO requires annotations to be in a specific format.

#### 2.1 **Labeling Tools**
There are several annotation tools that make this process easier:
- **LabelImg**: A popular and simple-to-use open-source tool.
  - Install LabelImg:
    ```bash
    pip install labelImg
    ```
  - Launch LabelImg:
    ```bash
    labelImg
    ```
  - In LabelImg, you will draw bounding boxes around ships and save the annotations in the YOLO format.
  
- **Roboflow**: A web-based tool for dataset annotation and management, with built-in support for YOLO format.

#### 2.2 **Annotation Format**
YOLO annotations consist of `.txt` files associated with each image. Each line in the file represents one object and its bounding box, and the format is as follows:
```
<class_id> <x_center> <y_center> <width> <height>
```

- **`class_id`**: The integer ID of the class (for ships, this would typically be `0`, since there's only one class).
- **`x_center`**: The normalized `x` coordinate of the bounding box center (relative to image width).
- **`y_center`**: The normalized `y` coordinate of the bounding box center (relative to image height).
- **`width`**: The normalized width of the bounding box (relative to image width).
- **`height`**: The normalized height of the bounding box (relative to image height).

All values (except `class_id`) are normalized between `0` and `1` based on the image’s dimensions.

##### Example:
For an image with dimensions `640x480`, if a ship is centered at `(320, 240)` with a bounding box size of `160x120`, the annotation line would be:
```
0 0.5 0.5 0.25 0.25
```

Each image will have an associated `.txt` file with this format, placed in the `labels` directory.

---

### **Step 3: Organize the Dataset**

To ensure YOLO can train and validate effectively, the dataset must be structured in a specific way. This directory layout allows YOLO to easily access training and validation data.

#### 3.1 **Folder Structure**

Your dataset should follow this structure:
```
/dataset
  /images
    /train  # Images for training
    /val    # Images for validation
  /labels
    /train  # Annotations for training images
    /val    # Annotations for validation images
```

- **Images Folder**: Should contain the `.jpg` or `.png` image files.
- **Labels Folder**: Should contain `.txt` files with YOLO-formatted annotations.

Ensure that each image in the `train` and `val` folders has a corresponding `.txt` file in the `labels/train` and `labels/val` folders.

#### 3.2 **Train-Validation Split**
- **Training set**: Contains the majority of images (usually 80%).
- **Validation set**: A smaller portion of images (usually 20%) used for validation during training.

You can split your dataset manually or use a tool like Roboflow to automate this. If you prefer Python, here's a simple way to split the dataset:

```python
import os
import random
import shutil

# Paths
dataset_dir = '/path/to/your/images'
train_dir = '/path/to/your/dataset/images/train'
val_dir = '/path/to/your/dataset/images/val'

# Create directories if they don't exist
os.makedirs(train_dir, exist_ok=True)
os.makedirs(val_dir, exist_ok=True)

# Split ratio (80% train, 20% val)
split_ratio = 0.8

# Get all image filenames
images = [f for f in os.listdir(dataset_dir) if f.endswith(('.jpg', '.png'))]

# Shuffle and split the dataset
random.shuffle(images)
train_count = int(len(images) * split_ratio)
train_images = images[:train_count]
val_images = images[train_count:]

# Move images and corresponding labels
for img in train_images:
    shutil.move(os.path.join(dataset_dir, img), os.path.join(train_dir, img))
    shutil.move(os.path.join(dataset_dir.replace('images', 'labels'), img.replace('.jpg', '.txt')), os.path.join(train_dir.replace('images', 'labels'), img.replace('.jpg', '.txt')))

for img in val_images:
    shutil.move(os.path.join(dataset_dir, img), os.path.join(val_dir, img))
    shutil.move(os.path.join(dataset_dir.replace('images', 'labels'), img.replace('.jpg', '.txt')), os.path.join(val_dir.replace('images', 'labels'), img.replace('.jpg', '.txt')))
```

This script will randomly shuffle the dataset and move 80% of the images and labels to the training folder and 20% to the validation folder.

---

### **Step 4: Data Augmentation (Optional)**

If your dataset is small or lacks diversity, you can perform data augmentation to artificially increase the dataset size and variability. YOLOv5 has built-in support for augmentations such as flipping, rotation, scaling, and brightness adjustments, but you can also apply augmentations before training.

Tools for augmentation:
- **Albumentations**: A popular Python library for data augmentation.
  
Example of augmentation using Albumentations:

```python
import albumentations as A
from PIL import Image
import cv2

# Define augmentations
transform = A.Compose([
    A.HorizontalFlip(p=0.5),
    A.RandomBrightnessContrast(p=0.2),
    A.Rotate(limit=30, p=0.3)
])

# Load image
image = cv2.imread('ship_image.jpg')

# Apply augmentations
augmented_image = transform(image=image)['image']

# Save augmented image
cv2.imwrite('augmented_ship_image.jpg', augmented_image)
```

Augmenting the dataset improves model generalization, especially when working with smaller datasets.

---

### **Step 5: Verify Dataset Integrity**

Ensure:
- Each image in the `images/train` and `images/val` folders has a corresponding `.txt` file in the `labels/train` and `labels/val` folders.
- The bounding box coordinates in each `.txt` file are correctly normalized (between 0 and 1).

You can use scripts to verify if all images have labels or if there are any mismatches.

---

### **Step 6: Create the Dataset YAML File**

Finally, create the `.yaml` configuration file that tells YOLO where your dataset is located and how many classes you have. For a ship detection task, the file might look like this:

```yaml
train: /path/to/your/dataset/images/train  # Path to training images
val: /path/to/your/dataset/images/val      # Path to validation images

nc: 1  # Number of classes
names: ['ship']  # List of class names
```

Save this file as `ships.yaml`, and you’ll use it when training the YOLO model.

---

### **Summary**

1. **Collect diverse images** of ships in various environments.
2. **Annotate** each image using LabelImg or Roboflow in YOLO format.
3. Organize your dataset into **train/val splits**.
4. Optionally apply **data augmentation** to improve the dataset’s diversity.
5. Create the **dataset YAML file** to specify your dataset’s structure for YOLO.

Once you’ve got this dataset ready, you're set to train the YOLO model. Would you like help with dataset annotation tools, augmentation, or any of these steps in more detail?

Downloading and using YOLO models offline for tasks such as ship detection requires several steps, from setting up the YOLO environment to configuring and running it on your dataset. I'll walk you through the process of downloading and running **YOLOv5** or **YOLOv8** models offline, as these are the most popular and accessible YOLO implementations.

---

### **Step 1: Download YOLOv5 or YOLOv8 Repository**

Both **YOLOv5** and **YOLOv8** can be used offline once you download the repository and install the necessary dependencies.

#### **1.1 Download YOLOv5 Repository**
To get YOLOv5 locally, you need to clone the YOLOv5 GitHub repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5
cd yolov5
```

Alternatively, for **YOLOv8**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics
cd ultralytics
```

### **Step 2: Install Dependencies**

Once you've cloned the repository, install the dependencies required to run the YOLO model. You will need Python 3.8+ and the required libraries.

#### **2.1 Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended)**
It’s best to create a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other Python libraries.

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv yolov5_env

# Activate the virtual environment
source yolov5_env/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
yolov5_env\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
```

#### **2.2 Install Required Libraries**

For **YOLOv5**, install the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For **YOLOv8**, use the following:

```bash
pip install ultralytics
```

---

### **Step 3: Download Pretrained YOLO Models**

YOLO comes with pretrained models (e.g., YOLOv5s, YOLOv5m, YOLOv5l, YOLOv5x) that can be fine-tuned on custom datasets. These models can be downloaded and used offline.

#### **3.1 Download Pretrained Weights**
By default, YOLO downloads weights automatically when running a script for the first time, but you can manually download the weights for offline use.

You can download the weights directly from the following links:

- **YOLOv5 models**:
  - [YOLOv5s (Small)](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/releases/download/v7.0/yolov5s.pt)
  - [YOLOv5m (Medium)](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/releases/download/v7.0/yolov5m.pt)
  - [YOLOv5l (Large)](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/releases/download/v7.0/yolov5l.pt)
  - [YOLOv5x (Extra Large)](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/releases/download/v7.0/yolov5x.pt)

- **YOLOv8 models**:
  - [YOLOv8n (Nano)](https://github.com/ultralytics/assets/releases/download/v0.0.0/yolov8n.pt)
  - [YOLOv8s (Small)](https://github.com/ultralytics/assets/releases/download/v0.0.0/yolov8s.pt)
  - [YOLOv8m (Medium)](https://github.com/ultralytics/assets/releases/download/v0.0.0/yolov8m.pt)
  - [YOLOv8l (Large)](https://github.com/ultralytics/assets/releases/download/v0.0.0/yolov8l.pt)

Download the model weights (`.pt` files) and save them locally.

---

### **Step 4: Prepare Your Custom Dataset**

For your ship detection task, make sure you have prepared your dataset in the proper structure as mentioned earlier:

- **Images**: Place your training and validation images into `train/` and `val/` directories.
- **Labels**: Corresponding YOLO-format `.txt` files for each image, containing the bounding boxes and class IDs.

Organize your dataset folder as follows:

```
/dataset
  /images
    /train  # Training images
    /val    # Validation images
  /labels
    /train  # Annotations for training images
    /val    # Annotations for validation images
```

Next, create a `.yaml` file describing the dataset structure for YOLO. Here's an example `ships.yaml` file:

```yaml
train: /path_to_your_dataset/images/train
val: /path_to_your_dataset/images/val

nc: 1  # Number of classes (1 for 'ship')
names: ['ship']  # Class name
```

---

### **Step 5: Training the Model Offline**

Now that you have the dataset and weights, you can start training the model offline.

#### **5.1 Training YOLOv5**

Use the following command to start training YOLOv5 on your dataset:

```bash
python train.py --img 640 --batch 16 --epochs 100 --data ships.yaml --weights yolov5s.pt --cache
```

Explanation of the command options:
- **`--img 640`**: Input image size (YOLOv5 typically uses 640x640 by default).
- **`--batch 16`**: Batch size (adjust according to your GPU memory).
- **`--epochs 100`**: Number of training epochs.
- **`--data ships.yaml`**: Path to the YAML file defining the dataset.
- **`--weights yolov5s.pt`**: Path to the pretrained weights.
- **`--cache`**: Caches the dataset in memory for faster training.

#### **5.2 Training YOLOv8**

For YOLOv8, the command to train is similar:

```bash
yolo task=detect mode=train model=yolov8s.pt data=ships.yaml epochs=100 imgsz=640
```

- **`task=detect`**: Specifies the task (YOLOv8 also supports segmentation and classification).
- **`mode=train`**: Indicates that we want to train the model.
- **`model=yolov8s.pt`**: Path to the model weights.
- **`data=ships.yaml`**: Path to the dataset YAML file.
- **`epochs=100`**: Number of training epochs.
- **`imgsz=640`**: Input image size.

---

### **Step 6: Run Inference Offline**

After training the model, you can use it to detect ships in new images or video streams.

#### **6.1 Running Inference with YOLOv5**

To run the trained YOLOv5 model on images, use the following command:

```bash
python detect.py --weights runs/train/exp/weights/best.pt --img 640 --source /path_to_images
```

- **`--weights`**: Path to the trained weights (best model from training).
- **`--img 640`**: Input image size.
- **`--source`**: Path to the image, video, or folder you want to run inference on.

#### **6.2 Running Inference with YOLOv8**

For YOLOv8, the process is very similar:

```bash
yolo task=detect mode=predict model=runs/detect/train/weights/best.pt source=/path_to_images
```

- **`mode=predict`**: Runs inference.
- **`model=best.pt`**: Path to the trained model weights.
- **`source`**: Path to the image or video file you want to test.

---

### **Step 7: Using the YOLO Model Offline with a Custom Application**

Once you’ve trained the YOLO model, you can integrate it into your offline applications for ship detection. Here are a few ways you can deploy the model offline:

1. **Run inference on local videos or images**: Use the `detect.py` or `yolo` scripts to process local files.
2. **Integrate YOLO with a Custom Pipeline**: YOLO models can be integrated with Python applications using PyTorch. You can load the model and run inference as part of a larger pipeline for maritime surveillance.

Example of running YOLOv5 in a Python script:
```python
import torch
from PIL import Image

# Load the YOLOv5 model
model = torch.hub.load('ultralytics/yolov5', 'custom', path='best.pt')

# Load image
img = Image.open('ship.jpg')

# Run inference
results = model(img)

# Display results
results.show()  # You can also save or process results
```

---

### **Summary**

1. **Download and Set Up YOLOv5 or YOLOv8**: Clone the repository and install dependencies.
2. **Prepare the Dataset**: Organize images and annotations, then create a `.yaml` file describing your dataset.
3. **Download Pretrained Models**: Download weights like `yolov5s.pt` for offline use.
4. **Train YOLO Offline**: Use the `train.py` or `yolo` script to train the model on your local machine.
5. **Run Inference**: After training, use the model to detect ships in new images or video streams offline.
